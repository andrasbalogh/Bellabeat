# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
## Bellabeat Marketing Analysis Case Study

The data is available through Kaggle.  [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). It consists of 18 csv files of various sizes. The largest one is 85.4 MB, which is too large for handling in spreadsheet, but it is perfectly fine for R. I decided to use RStudio on my laptop for the data analysis.
